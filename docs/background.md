The price volatility of cryptocurrencies is a major barrier to mass adoption. Its rapid change in fiat-denominated value causes payment amounts to vary even during settlement times, making it highly inconvenient for merchants that handle them.

**Stablecoins** are cryptocurrencies with an exchange rate peg against existing fiat currencies (such as the US dollar) or a fiat-related index, thereby drastically increasing their usefulness as a payment medium.

### Algorithmic Central Banks

Although a wide variety of stablecoin mechanisms exist, Basis Dollar specifically uses an “algorithmic central bank” approach to manage the supply of tokens according to a predetermined logic. The algorithm is in charge of balancing stablecoin supply to fluctuating demand, ensuring that the token price remains relatively stable. Further details are available under the Mechanisms section.
