Basis Dollar Improvement Proposals

---

## Where can I access all the Basis Dollar Improvement Proposals?

All proposals can be found at https://gov.basisdollar.fi

## How do I submit a proposal?

Preferably, you share your proposal idea in telegram and discord beforehand first. This allows all potential proposals to go through a pre-proposal discussion first. This type of discussion helps strengthen the proposal.

The interface to create proposals can be found at https://gov.basisdollar.fi/#/basisdollar.eth/create

## Who is eligible to vote on a proposal?

Eligible voters are:

- BSDS stakers in Seignorage Shares
- BSDS stakers in the LPs (BSDS/DAI and BSDS/USDC) in Shares Bank

If you hold BSDS in a wallet, or if you hold no BSDS, you are not eligible to vote.

## What are the past proposals? What was the outcome?

You can find all past proposals at https://gov.basisdollar.fi/#/basisdollar.eth/all
